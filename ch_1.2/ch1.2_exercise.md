## 1. $ S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5,6\}$
>>> A. Just complete $2^6 =  64$ - This is because there are 2 choices for each place of the original set, so it would be $2^6$
>>> B. Do the equation $2^3 = 8$ - This is similar to first answer!
>>> C. Since there are 8 subsets that do not contain an odd number from $2^3$ then we can substract the entire subset combinations by the even ones: $2^6 - 2^3 = 64 - 8 = 56$
>>> D. Ther are $2^3$ that contain only even numbers, and there are $2^3$ that are only odd numbers. Then we subtract that from 40 to get 24 subsets.

### 2. 
>>> A. Compute the $(^6_4) = 720/48  = 15$
>>> B. 3 subsets from $(^3_1)$
>>> C. 15 subsets because half the nuumber in the sets are odd 
>>> D. 3 subsets because we pick one of the three even numbers

#### 3. 
>>>> A. Very similar to the begining, because once again there is a yes/no options for each value so just $2^9 = 512$
>>>> B.
