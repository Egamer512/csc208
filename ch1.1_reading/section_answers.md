1. To do this problem, just multiply the 5, 3, and 17. This would mean that there are 255 outfits.

2. 
        
        a. You can just add the options to have 8 options for neck wear

        b. 15 options 

        c. Do this equation: 5 * (4+3) + 7 = 42. You have to do this equation because there is an or for pants and skirts, and then you have to multiply by the shirts because thats's one of the outfits. You can also choose the dress so you add that at the end.

3. If you have 9 comedies and 7 horror movies:
        
        a. How many choices of movies do you have?
        b. If you were feeling really bored, what are the total, unique combinations of moviesc can you watch?


5. 

        a. If B included the elements of A, then there will be 10 common elements between the 2.
        b. Both sets A and B may not have any elements that are the same, so the smallest value would be zero.
        c. It is between 15 and 25. This is because if Set A and Set B had values where Set B had the values that Set A has, then the amount of distinct values betwene the 2 would be 15. If Set A and B did not have any values in common, then it would be 25. Of course, it doesn't only have csto be the extremes, so it is between 15 and 25, inclusive.


6. Remember this equation

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|$$

What the prior does is that it simplifies the equation as the two intersections would cancel out. This would make the answer 13.
