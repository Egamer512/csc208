#### You can not predict the ouput of 

#### For example:
1. Imagine having a function where we know:
    ***f(1) = 1***
    ***f(2) = 4***
    ***f(3) = 9***
    ***f(4) = 16***
2. We can't predict the the value of f(5) = 25, as it was not stated in the function
3. We can set it so that f(5) = 25 or f(n) = n^2
