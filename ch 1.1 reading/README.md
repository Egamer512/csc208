The **addidtive** principle is where an event A can occur in "m" ways, while event B can occur in "n" ways.

Both "m" and "n" are *disjointed* meaning that they can only "happen" seperately. 

So in an event where "A or B" can occur, just add the "m" and "n" <-- We can do this because m and n are **seperate** and only can occur **once**. 

The **multiplicative** principle is A can occur in "m" ways, while event B can occur in "n" ways. If there is an event where A AND B can occur, then it can occur in m * n ways.

With sets, the additive principle similarily. Imagine having 2 sets where A and B have nothing in common:

$$ A \cap B = \emptyset $$

This means that: 

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$$

It makes sense bcause imagine having 2 sets with completely unique values within. You can add all those unique values because they are not common in both sets.

The multiplicative princple with sets is pretty straight forward:

$$|A \times B|  = |A| \times |B| $$
