#### You can not predict the ouput of a function, if it has not been explicitly told. For example:
1. Imagine having a function where we know:

2. We can't predict the the value of f(5) = 25, as it was not stated in the function
3. But if we state that f(n) = n^2, then it is possible to state that f(6) = 36

What you just saw is a ***closed formula***, which are explicit formulas calculating all values in the domain

**We can also define functions revursively**<br>
&nbsp; There is an *initial condition*, explicitly setting f(0)
<br>&nbsp; There is a *recurrance relation*, a formula for f((n)+1) in terms of f(n), so we need the value of f(n)
