1. To do this problem, just multiply the 5, 3, and 17. This would mean that there are 255 outfits.

2. 
        
        a. You can just add the options to have 8 options for neck wear

        b. 15 options 

        c. Do this equation: 5 * (4+3) + 7 = 42. You have to do this equation because there is an or for pants and skirts, and then you have to multiply by the shirts because thats's one of the outfits. You can also choose the dress so you add that at the end.

3. If you have 9 comedies and 7 horror movies:
        
        a. How many choices of movies do you have?

        b. If you were feeling really bored, what are the total, unique combinations of movies can you watch?


5. 

        a. If B included the elements of A, then there will be 10 common elements between the 2.

        b. Both sets A and B may not have any elements that are the same, so the smallest value would be zero.

        c. It is between 15 and 25. This is because if Set A and Set B had values where Set B had the values that Set A has, then the amount of distinct values betwene the 2 would be 15. If Set A and B did not have any values in common, then it would be 25. Of course, it doesn't only have csto be the extremes, so it is between 15 and 25, inclusive.


6. Remember this equation

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\cap B|$$

What the prior does is that it simplifies the equation as the two intersections would cancel out. This would make the answer 13.

7. Use the cardinality of 3 sets:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A\cap B| - |A\cap C| - |B\cap C| + |A\cap B\cap C|$$

So then you will get 39 (28+19+24-16-10+8).

8. By doing the carindality of 3 sets you will get 24, and so by doing the subtractoin 30 - 24 = 6, you can conclude that 6 people HATE potatoes!

9. ONCE AGAIN USE THE CARDINALITY OF THE UNION PRINCIPLE:

$$500/5 = 100$$
$$500/6 \approx 83$$
$$500/7 \approx 71$$
$$500/(5*6) \approx 16$$
$$500/(5*7) \approx 14$$
$$500/(6*7) \approx 11$$
$$500/(5*6*7) \approx 2$$
$$100+83+71-16-14-11+2 = 215$$

11. 
        
        a. Just gotta remember the formula for the Cardinality of a union for 2 sets:

$$|A \cup B| = |A| + |C| - |A\cap C|$$
$$ |A| = 50, |C| = 40, and  |A\cup C| = 15$$
$$ 50 + 40 - 15 = 75$$

12. 
        
        a. If there are 8 combinatinos for each letter for the word, then multiply 8 by itself 5 times: 

$$8^5 = 32,756$$
        b. There are 8 choices for the first letter, and  this decreases incrementally to 4 letters for that fith letter.
$$ 8 \times7\times6\times5\times4 = 6,720$$

        c. The last two letters of the word would have 8 combinations for each place. Then you can just multiply 8 by itself to get 64.

        d. Similar to the last question but you can add the 64s so you get 128.

        e. You can use the equation from part b, so you start with 6,720. You can then use the formula by remembering that there are 3 distinct position to actually have the the possibility of putting that subword whivhv is the begining, middle, and end. Then what you do is that you know there can't be a word that is repeating in that list of words so you have to multuply 5 and 4 because those are the only ways to "fill" in the last two characters:

$$ 3 \times (20) = 60$$
$$ 6720 - 60 = 6660$$
