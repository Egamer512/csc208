## Sequences are order lists of numbers, so for example: $ x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}...x_{n} $

### To refer to the entire sequence we can just do: $ (a_{x})_{n E N} $

### The numbers in the subscript are known was indices (like the position)

### A closed formula for a sequence of all natural numbers is a formula for $a_{n}$ and using fixed finite number operations on n

## Common Sequences:
### Square Numbers: $ 1, 4, 9, 25 $
### Triangular Numbers: $ 1, 3, 6, 10 $ - Closed formula of $T(_{n})_{n>=1}$ where $T_{n} = n(n+1)/2 $
### Power of 2 Numbers: $ 1, 2, 4, 8 $ - Closed formula of $T(_{n})_{n>=0}$ where $T_{n} = 2^n $
### Fabbocinni Numbers: $ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 $ - Recursive formula of $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} $ where $F_{1} = F_{2} = 1$
