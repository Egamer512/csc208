The **addidtive** principle is where an event A can occur in "m" ways, while event B can occur in "n" ways.

Both "m" and "n" are *disjointed* meaning that they can only "happen" seperately. 

So in an event where "A or B" can occur, just add the "m" and "n" <-- We can do this because m and n are **seperate** and only can occur **once**.
